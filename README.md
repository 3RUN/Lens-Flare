# Lens Flare
Simple lens flare collection based on contribution of Prete aka Priest. <br />
Migrated into lite-C and refactored by me.

It includes:
- pretty complex lens flare from the sun
- simple ones from lights

WSAD - movement <br />
Cursor keys - move the sun <br />
Hold MRB + mouse - rotate camera <br />
Click on light bulbs to remove them and their lens flare. <br />
